## Getting Started
First, run the `React` development server:
```bash
npm run start
```
Since the dApp is currently not deployed on the ethereum mainnet, you'll need to setup a local blockchain and connect it to your preffered crypto wallet. We'll also need to have a cryptocurrency wallet and a personal ethereum blockchain. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) as a wallet and [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache) as a local blockchain are the preffered options.

Next, you'll need to install `truffle` by using 
```bash
npm install -g truffle
```
Once installed, you can now deploy the smart contracts on your local blockchain (Keep an ethereum blockchain environment running in the background with Ganache) by using
```bash
truffle compile
and then
truffle migrate
```
If the above steps are done right, you'll see a message similar to this in your terminal.

Last and final step is to connect your wallet to your blockchain network. This can be done easily by going to the `Add Network` section in your wallet and connecting with the right RPC server.

Once done, you're good to go. Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the app.
